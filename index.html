            Alabama, Arkansas, I do love my Ma and Pa
            Not the way that I do love you
            Well, holy moly, me oh my, you're the apple of my eye
            Girl, I've never loved one like you
            Man, oh, man, you're my best friend, I scream into the nothingness
            There ain't nothing that I need
            Well, hot and heavy pumpkin pie, chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
            Ain't nothing please me more than you
            Oh, home, let me come home
            Home is whenever I'm with you
            Oh, home, let me come home
            Home is wherever I'm with you
        </p>
